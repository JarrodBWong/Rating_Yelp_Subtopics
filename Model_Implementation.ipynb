I was looking at the menu and debating what I should get and there was nobody in front of me but the person at the register didn't bother to greet me or ask me if I was ready to order. Even when I decided, I had to wait for him because he kept fumbling around and even left for a few minutes. There were 2 other employees who I assumed were in charge of making the drinks but they didn't greet either. After a few minutes standing there, the employee finally took my order. I'm not super picky about service but I was a bit ticked off. \\n\\nWhen me and my friends both got our drinks at the front, they didn't have the lids on so I saw that one had a nice ish latte design on it and the other was a poorly made design. I don't know if the barista was inconsistent or if two different people made it but either way I was not too happy. I didn't even bother taking a photo of mine. \\n\\nService aside, the spanish latte was pretty good but it was a bit too sweet, especially when it cooled down you can really taste how sweet it was. The place was pretty and I like the interior as well as the atmosphere of the place. It has a very hipstery-feel to it and a lot of college students seem to chill here. Seems like a  nice place to chill and drink coffee. I wouldn't mind trying other drinks and chilling here but service is just average.\",\n",
